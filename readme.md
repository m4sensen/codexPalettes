# CodexPalettes: RGB Color Palette from Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This repository contains a collection of color palettes extracted from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and converted from **OKLCH** color space to standard **RGB** values.

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

- All color values are defined as RGB triplets (space-separated values).
- Format: `COLOR_NAME="R G B"`
- Easy to parse, simple to use in any environment.
- Original color values are based on Tailwind's design tokens.
- Conversion from OKLCH to RGB ensures compatibility with platforms that don't yet support OKLCH.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is intended for developers, designers, and toolmakers who want quick, consistent access to Tailwind CSS color values in RGB format.

Whether you're working in environments that donâ€™t support OKLCH yet, building CLI tools, generating UI themes, or writing scripts â€” CodexPalettes gives you a ready-to-use, portable format for referencing colors with readable variable names.

## ðŸ“š Source

- Color names and values are originally defined in the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) color palette.
- OKLCH definitions are sourced from the Tailwind teamâ€™s official design tokens (v3+).
- RGB conversion was done using a color space conversion tool or script.
